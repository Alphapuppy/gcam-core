We have two parameters that shift up the cost of producing oil.,,,,,,,
,environCost,which we set long ago to 0.12,,,2.232,$/bbl,
,severancetax,which we set a few years ago to 0.75,,,,13.95,up from an older value
,,this was set simply as a mechanism to calibrate model prices up a bit,,,,,

"I don’t believe this was literally a severance tax based on data, or hasn't been for several years",,,,,,,
"in the absence of a better parameter, I will use the severance tax to adjust up the near-term prices a bit",,,,,,,

not sure this will work,,,,,,,

"Gas prices - assume eventually converge to a global price, but some regions are still lower in the near term due to having more supply than they could use and export",,,,,,,,,,,,
so add a regional markup to some regions,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As of start of 2008 CCTP exercise, that regional natural gas non-energy input cost is set at 0.25 (1975$/GJ) for all regions for all periods",,,,,,,,,,,,
,So increase will have to be added to the 0.25,,,,,,,,,,,
