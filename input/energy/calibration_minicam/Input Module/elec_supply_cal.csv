Notes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Replaced technology names to match names in GTSP version (e.g., ""Existing"")",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Remove hydro and nuclear efficiency - leave model assumption as is.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Remove duplicate calinput values for oil and gas.  Also efficiencies (though they would not hurt),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Hydro and Nuclear are in new table, fixedoutput, rather than calibrated. Since IEA hydro efficiencies were about 1, fixedoutput = what was in for calinput.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"for nuclear, computed fixedoutput based on input and read in efficiencies",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Removed Geo for now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"FSU was still zero, I typed in 1990 values from GTSP input file",,,,,,,,Nuclear_switch,,,,,,,,electricity supplied,,,,,deltas,,,IEA losses,
China efficiencies were way off.  I typed in old values,,,,,,,,1,"1=caloutput, 0 = fixedoutput",,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,
