The variable HHID will be on all files.  Each respondent is assigned
an unique value of HHID.  It can be used to merge data from one file
with data from another file.

     Minimum Value: 1,001
     Maximum Value: 8,111

NWEIGHT 'The Final Weight'                                  Columns 6-11

The sample design for RECS is not a simple random sample. Consequently,
to estimate the number or percent of households/housing units with a
certain characteristic, the sampling weight should be used.  The
variable NWEIGHT is the sampling weight for the observation.  It is
approximately the inverse of the probability of selection.  It gives
the number of households that the response represents in the sample. 
For most categorical variables, the codebooks contain both the
unweighted frequency and the weighted frequency.  The unweighted
frequency gives the number of observations, the weighted frequency
gives survey estimate of the number of households/housing units for
each possible value of the variable.  The weighted frequencies are
rounded to the nearest 100,000 households.  This is the limit of the
accuracy for RECS.  When the unweighted frequency is less than 10 or
the weighted frequency is less than 150,000; then weighted frequency is
suppressed.  A 'Q' is placed in the frequency to denote that the number
is suppressed.  This indicates that there are too few observation upon
which to determine an accurate estimate.

     9         6,996          95,100,000

When QMAIL equals 1, the household and housing unit data was 
not obtained via a personal interview.  The data were obtained using a
shortened mail questionnaire.  A hot-deck imputation procedure was used
to match each mail respondent to a personal interview respondent.  The
critical matching variables were FUELHEAT, FUELH2O, TYPECOOL, TYPEHUQ,
and REGIONC.  Additional variables used in a scoring function to
determine the best match were MONEYPY, NHSLDMEM, VEHICLES, HHAGE, and
TOTROOMS.  The remaining household/housing unit characteristics for the
mail respondents were determined by the values of the matched personal
interview respondent.  The energy consumption and expenditures data for
the mail respondents was based upon data obtained from their energy
suppliers.  It was not imputed using a hot deck procedure.

Questionnaire data from personal interview respondents sometime is
missing and needs to be imputed.  'Z' variables are used to indicate
the presence of imputed data.  For example, if ZURBRUR = 0 then URBRUR
was not imputed.  If ZURBRUR = 1 then URBRUR was imputed.

CDD65 and HDD65 are weather data.  The values of CDD65 and HDD65 were based 
upon data obtained from the NOAA.  A random error was added to both HDD65 and 
CDD65 to mask the location of the weather station from which the data was 
obtained.

Cooling degree days are the number of degrees the average daily
temperature (ADT) is above the base temperature.  Heating degree days
are the number of degrees the ADT is below the base temperature.  To
calculate daily degree days (base 65 degrees):

          ADT = (daily high + daily low)/2

          CDD(daily)     = 0            if ADT <= 65
                         = ADT - 65     if ADT > 65

          HDD(daily)     = 0            if ADT >= 65
                         = 65 - ADT     if ADT < 65.

Annual degrees days are calculated by summing the daily degree days. 
The .5 is carried over in the summation.  The total is rounded up after
the summation.
