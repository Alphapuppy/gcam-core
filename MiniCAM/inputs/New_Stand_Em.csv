SRESCALB--Calibration values to pass Standardized SRES values,,,,,

This file makes CO2 and deforestation emissions match the SRES standardized values for 1990 and 2000 before they are passed to MAGICC.,,,,,
,This makes near-term CO2 concentrations reasonalbe,,,,
,Also significantly improves long-term concentrations (given that MiniCAM doesn't produce cement emissions),,,,

Index,1990 Value,2000 Value,Gas,,
1,6.09,7.22,CO2-Fos & Industry,,This value is larger than the acutal year 2000 value 
2,1.1,1.1,CO2-Deforestation,,This is becaue emissions are expected to be concave during this period
3,0,0,SO2-OECD90,,This is the value that gives the proper extrapolation between 1990 & 2005
4,0,0,SO2-REF,,Provides for about a .22 TgC offset for cement emissions
5,0,0,SO2-Asia_other,,
6,0,0,SO2-Asia_CPA
7,0,0,SO2-Latin America
8,0,0,SO2-Africa & Middle East
