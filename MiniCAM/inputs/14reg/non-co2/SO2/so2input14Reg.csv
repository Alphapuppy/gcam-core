SULFUR EMISSIONS INPUT FILE,,,,,,,
"For emissions in TgS, use: (Fuel Use in EJ) / (GJ/Tonne) * (S %/100) * 1000 * (1 - f_control%)",,,,,,,
Biomass has fixed emission coefficient,,,,equal to that of wood,,,
"For nat gas, the factor below is really the emissions rate, not S%",,,,,,,

"To calibrate S emissions in dev regions, first check PPP/Cap and adjust GDP0 appropriately if changed",,,,,,,
"If S emissions in region such as Japan (with maxed out controls) does not go down, adjust final S % of pet products",,,,,,,

SO2SCT Sulfur content (percentage by weight),,,,,,,
