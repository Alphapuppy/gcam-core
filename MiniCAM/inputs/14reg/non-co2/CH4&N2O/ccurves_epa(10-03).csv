COST CURVES for other gas mitigation

*********************************************************************************************************
NOTES:
the data is from the EPA cost curve spreadsheets -- generated automatically by CCURVES MACRO.xls: make changes there and then rerun the macro
FORMAT: first row of each curve is carbon tax -- second row is percent reduction as if carbon tax was applied using standard
uses 100 yr GWP 's (21 for methane and 310 for N2O) -- changes in GWP do not need to be made here as it is coded into the model

FILE also contains parameters for energy price adjustments to cost curves
"Below zero reductions are applied in all scenarios, including base cases (I.e., assumed that these become part of the baseline)"

"Sensitivity to energy prices -- 1 indicates movement directly with gas prices, < 1 indicates less efficient/partial recovery of methane"
"(approximate conversion of 9.1 GJ CH4 per TCE is used if this parameter is set to 1, otherwise it is proportionally less)"

"Data Source (11/02 mj):  Plotted representative curves from the EPA spreadsheets, estimated sensitivity to energy prices"
Note that sensitivity roughly corresponds to quality of recovered gas/use for resale.  So Gas and Coal have high figures (most recovered gas is resold)
whereas oil (flaring) and landfill (low-quality recovered gas) tend to have less sensitivity to energy prices.  The manure curves tend to be very responsive
for some reason.  All of these have been scaled down slightly together (dampen rapid price changes) in the calib.xls file.
