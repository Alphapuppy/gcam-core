Note:
"1.  Emission coefficients of all Asian regions are directly taken from Aardenne, John A., Anthropogenic NOx emissions in Asia in"
"     the period 1990-2020, Atmospheric Environment 33 (1999) 633-646"
"2.  Default emission coefficient for WEUR, Canada and Aus&NewZ uses the emission coefficient for Japan from Aardenne."
"     Other regions like FSU, Middle East, Africa, Latin America and Eastern European uses emission coefficient from Aardenne"
     for other Asian region.
3.  The emission coefficients of Japan and other Asian regions are different as the OCED/IEA (data source for this study) study 
"     assumes for all Asian countries, with exception of Japan, that no abatement technology is used."
"4.  The coefficient for coal is taken as the mean of brown coal, hard coal and derived coal, and same is done for heavy fuel, medium"
"     distillates (diesel oil) and light fraction (gasoline, LPG, kerosene)"
"5.  The emission coefficient for industrial wood, transportation coal and transportation wood of Asian Region is used "
     as the default as vaue for all other regions.
"6.  Emission coefficient of Japan is used as default value for transportation wood for USA, Canada and Western Europe and "
     rest are same as the Other Asian Regions.
