COST CURVES for other gas mitigation,,,,,,

NOTES:,,,,,,
the data is from the EPA cost curve spreadsheets -- generated by CCURVES MACRO.xls,,,,,,
FORMAT: first row of each curve is carbon tax -- second row is percent reduction as if carbon tax was applied using,,,,,,
standard 100 yr GWP's -- changes in GWP do not need to be made here as it is coded into the model,,,,,,
