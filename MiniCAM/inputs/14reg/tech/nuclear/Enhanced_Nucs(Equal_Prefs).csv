 BSUILM Logit function scale parameters for electricity,,,,NOTE: shares between 1990 and 2050 are automatically overwitten,,,,,,,,,
INPUT_TABLE,,,,Most techs have equal base shares in 2050,,,,,,,,,
 Variable ID,,,,Extrapolate between 1990 and 2050,,,,,,,,,
472,,,,"Coal is an exception -- deviates from price-derivied shares in many regions, so extrapolation is extended to 2065 and is non-linear",,,,,,,,,
