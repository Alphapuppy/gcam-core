VISLM--ENVIRONMENTAL COST AMOUNTS BY REGION AND FUEL (UNITS=1975 DOLLARS/GIGAJOULE),,,,,,,,,,,
INPUT_TABLE,,,,,,,Gas,No environmental cost,,,
Variable ID,,,,Global env costs,,,Coal,Twice that of oil,,Coal env costs in 2095 = one half 1975 extraction costs,
69,,,,,,,Unconv oil,Three times that of oil,,This increases costs by about 10-15% for coal,
