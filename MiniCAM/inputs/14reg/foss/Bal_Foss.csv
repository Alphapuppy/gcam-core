BESIL--MINIMUM LEVEL OF SHORT-TERM SUPPLY BY TYPE AND REGION,,,,,,
allow coal industry to recover after market goes zero in any period,,,,,,
INPUT_TABLE,,,"Now -- also allow other production to re-start - but limit slightly, which damps oscillations",,,
Variable ID,,,Min short-term supply set larger for Uncon oil (or else doesn't come on),,,
22,,,"For other fuels, set to 1 EJ except for coal, which is equal to production in 1990",,,
