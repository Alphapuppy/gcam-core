This sheet renames the fuel inputs to the H2 consuming technologies in aggregate demand sectors,,
The buildings sector hydrogen technology is removed,,
"Industry and transportation now only have one tech, as the H2 production pathways converge in ""H2 Enduse""",,
Non-energy costs are not changed from CCSP,,
Future shareweights set to 1 (were 0.447242 in industry; not sure why),,
