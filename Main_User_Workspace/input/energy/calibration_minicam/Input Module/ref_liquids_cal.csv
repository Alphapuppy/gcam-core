This worksheet calibrates the biomass and crude inputs to refined liquids enduse,,,,,,
It is assumed that industry does not use any biomass liquids in the base years (black liquor inputs are accounted as biomass),,,,,,
METHOD,,,,,,
,IO coefficients from the refined liquids workbook are used to calculate the total inputs to the refining sector in all regions,,,,,
,The original energy consumption of refined liquids by the industrial sector includes the consumption of crude oil by the refining sector.,,,,,
,Industry energy-use consumption of refined liquids is calculated from Enduse_no_heat and heat worksheets (i.e. not final_enduse_cal),,,,,
,Refined liquids enduse output equal to the consumption by the end use sectors,,,,,
,,Inputs are calculated by the coefficients,,,,
,"Refined liquids industrial output is more complicated (see calculations below) as it depends on the consumption by the industrial sector, which is getting adjusted in this method.",,,,,
