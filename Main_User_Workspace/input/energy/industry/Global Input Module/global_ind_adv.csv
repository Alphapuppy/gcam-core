This sheet changes the efficiencies of the aggregate industrial sectors of all regions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is based on the assumed efficiencies and calinputs to the US industrial module.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It uses model output from a scenario run,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No inter-regional variation is assumed here; inter-regional variation (as computed throughout this workbook) is in the AEII,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Industry final energy consumption by technology and fuel,,,,,,,,,,,,,
