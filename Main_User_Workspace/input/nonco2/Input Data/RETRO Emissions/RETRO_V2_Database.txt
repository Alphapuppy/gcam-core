Data Reference
Schultz, M. G., & Heil, A., & Hoelzemann, J. J., & Spessa, A., & Thonicke, K., & Goldammer, J. 
G., et al. (2008). Global wildland fire emissions from 1960 to 2000, Global 
Biogeochemical Cycles, 22, GB2002, doi:10.1029/2007GB003031

Input Files: All_Fires_Countries.xls, All_Fires_Regions.xls
These workbooks contain 1960 to 2000 global vegetation fire emissions data (Tg/year) for 
regions and selected countries of the RETRO project. The original CSV data files per 
chemical/species (e.g. ACETONE, BC, etc) were stored per worksheet by corresponding input 
file. Note that the field “chemical” was added to each worksheet as the first column.

Modules: importCountries_RETRO, importRegions_RETRO
These modules import the input files into the tblCountries_RETRO_Fires_V2 and 
tblRegions_RETRO_Fires_V2 tables, respectively. Note that only columns A1:Z124, in 
All_Fires_Countries.xls, and A1:U124, in All_Fires_Regions.xls, are imported.

After the first worksheet is added to the table, the rest of the worksheets are appended 
consecutively to the end of the table. Note that the user must update the variable srtFileName to 
the corresponding path of each input file.

Tables
The tables, tblCountries_RETRO_Fires_V2 and tblRegions_RETRO_Fires_V2, show the data 
imported from the input files. tblMinicamRegions displays the 14 Minicam regions and their 
respective region id.

The tblMinicamRETRO table was created in order to aggregate the fire emissions data into the 
Minicam regions. This table maps to each Minicam region a country or one or more RETRO 
regions, according to the Minicam and RETRO region definitions. Note that this table can be 
altered to produce data for other regional desegregations.

To prevent double counting, if both a country and a region including that country are assigned to 
a Minicam region, the emissions of the country is subtracted from the region and the remaining 
data is stored in the “rest_of” the region. For this purpose, tblMapRegions, maps each RETRO 
region with the available RETRO countries. 

The table, tblFinal_RETRO_Fires_V2, compiles the RETRO fire emissions data for both the 
RETRO countries and regions, as well as for the “rest_of” regions.

Queries
The normalizing union queries, qryNormalizingUnionQuery_Countries and 
qryNormalizingUnionQuery_Regions, restructure the imported data so that the countries and 
regions are no longer fields but records within each table.
 
As the normalizing union queries are written in SQL, these are converted to Design View Select 
queries, namely, appndTBLEmissions_Countries and mkeTBLEmissions_Regions, for easier 
manipulation of the data.

The query, qrySubtract_Regions, aggregates the fire emissions data of those countries assigned to 
a Minicam region and which are included in RETRO regions also assigned to a Minicam region. 
To prevent double counting, these fire emissions data are subtracted from the emissions of the 
corresponding region in appndRest_of_Regions; simultaneously, the resulting emissions data for 
each region is stored in “rest_of” region records.

The final query, qryRETRO_Fires_ByMinicam, aggregates the data into Minicam regions 
according to the definitions in the tblMinicamRETRO table. This query extracts the emissions 
data from the table, tblFinal_RETRO_Fires_V2. 

Note that the query descriptions within the database assign a number to each of the queries. The 
tblFinal_RETRO_Fires_V2 table was created using queries [3], [4], and [6], and should be 
updated using these queries.

The RETRO.mdb MS Access database was created by Sabrina Delgado Arias at the Joint Global 
Change Research Institute, globalchange.umd.edu.
