\subsection faqitem1 How does a STL container iterator work?
Container iterators are declared as containerName<type>::iterator iteratorName. The iterator then behaves as a pointer
to the item within the container it points at, and pointer operations can be perfomed on it, such as dereferencing. If 
the container held pointers to objects, the iterator must be dereferenced twice in order to access the object. Put example here.
